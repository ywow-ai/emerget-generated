> I have a partially built frontend application. I want you to help me complete it by adding and adjusting the following features and pages.

>

> The app currently has some basic structure, but please modify or extend it so that it includes:

>

> 1. **Feed Page:**

>

> * Ability to view comments under each post.

> * Ability to share a post/feed.

> 2. **Event Pages:**

>

> * Event detail page.

> * Pre-checkout page.

> * Checkout page.

> * After-checkout (confirmation/success) page.

> 3. **Costume Pages:**

>

> * Costume detail page.

> * Pre-checkout page.

> * Checkout page.

> * After-checkout (confirmation/success) page.

> 4. **Create Pages:**

>

> * Create costume page.

> * Create event page.

> * Create feed page.

>

> All of these are **frontend only** — no backend or real database connection needed.

>

> Use **static data** where necessary (for example, to display comments, events, and costume information).

>

> Please use a **modern React (or Next.js) frontend** with **Tailwind CSS** for styling, and make the layout clean, minimal, and responsive.

>

> Include clear navigation between all the pages (e.g., via a navbar or sidebar).

>

> Make sure each page is functional from a user interface perspective, even if the data is mock or static.

1. I already have existing code. Please check the routes in `App.js` to understand the current structure and existing pages.
2. The app is focused on *Japanese-themed events* — it includes event information, event tickets, and costume rentals. There’s also a social feed similar to social media.
3. Please follow the current design style already used in the existing project. You can analyze the existing components and styling to stay consistent.
4. The login system already exists (mock only). **Do not modify it.**
